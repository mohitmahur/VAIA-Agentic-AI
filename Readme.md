# AI Market Analyst Agent

The **AI Market Analyst** is a Streamlit-based intelligent agent powered by **Google Gemini (via LangChain)** that can perform:
- Market Q&A  
- Executive-level Summarization  
- Structured Competitor Data Extraction  

It reads and analyzes your market research text file (`innovate_q3_2025.txt`) and provides deep, AI-powered insights.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1-  Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohitmahur/VAIA-Agentic-AI.git
cd VAIA-Agentic-AI
```



### Step 2- Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step $- Add Your Google API Key
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

> You can generate this key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

##  Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser.

##  Design Decisions (Crucial)

### 1. **Chunking Strategy

Chunk Size: 1000 characters

Overlap: 200 characters
This provides optimal context retention for Gemini while avoiding context window overflow. It ensures that important cross-paragraph connections are not lost during retrieval.

### 2. **Embedding Model

Model Used: models/text-embedding-004
Chosen for its semantic precision and speed, making it suitable for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows involving textual data from market reports.

### 3. **Vector Database

Database: FAISS
FAISS provides fast in-memory similarity search with low latency â€” ideal for local, lightweight document retrieval setups. It integrates seamlessly with LangChain and doesnâ€™t require external servers.

### 4. **Data Extraction Prompt

The extraction prompt uses strict Pydantic schema enforcement to ensure well-structured JSON outputs.
By defining CompetitorAnalysis and Competitor models, Gemini is guided to adhere exactly to schema constraints, reducing hallucination and formatting errors.


### **API Usage (Gemini Models)

LLM Model: gemini-2.5-flash

Embedding Model: models/text-embedding-004
These are part of the Google Generative AI suite, accessed via LangChainâ€™s ChatGoogleGenerativeAI and GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings.

### 5. **API Usage Examples**

#### ðŸ”¹ General Q&A
```python
response = agent.perform_general_qa("What are the top competitors in the Q3 report?")
")
print(response)
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Summarization
```python
summary = agent.get_market_research_findings()
print(summary)
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Structured Data Extraction
```python
data = agent.extract_structured_data()
print(data.dict())
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Auto Routing
```python
route = agent.route_query("Summarize the competitor section").tool_name
print(route)
```
